# Research about the Malware Incidents

## 1. DaVita Ransomware Attack

In April 14, 2025, the U.S. dialysis provider DaVita suffered a ransomware incident that affected nearly 2.7 million people. Hackers managed to encrypt parts of the company's IT systems and potentially accessed patient records.

**How it worked:**

- The attackers deployed ransomware to lock DaVita's network and threatened to release stolen information. While the exact entry point wasn't publicly disclosed, ransomware attacks like this often exploit phishing emails, stolen credentials, or weak remote access services.

**How it was handled:**

- DaVita quickly isolated the affected systems and kept critical dialysis services running without interruption. The company notified patients, offered credit monitoring services, and started a forensic investigation with outside experts. The attack was costly (around $13.5 million in recovery expenses) but no long-term disruption to patient care was reported.

## 2. Inotiv Ransomware Attack

On August 8, 2025, Inotiv, a U.S. pharmaceutical and biotech company, was targeted by the Qilin ransomware group. The group claimed responsibility and boasted about stealing more than 160,000 files from the company.

**How it worked:**

- The attackers infiltrated Inotiv's IT environment, encrypting servers, data storage, and internal business applications. This forced the company to shut down large parts of its digital infrastructure and temporarily rely on manual or offline processes.

**How it was handled:**

- Inotiv reported the incident to authorities and hired third-party cybersecurity specialists to investigate and rebuild their systems. Forensic teams are still assessing the full extent of the stolen data, but the company has since restored many services and continues to strengthen its cyber defenses.

## 3. Crocodilus Android Banking Trojan

In March 2025, researchers discovered that the Crocodilus Android banking trojan was spreading beyond Turkey and Spain into Europe, South America, and other regions. Unlike ransomware, this threat targets individuals rather than large organizations.

**How it worked:**

- Crocodilus often disguises itself as a legitimate app like Google Chrome and tricks users into installing it. Once inside the phone, it abuses Android Accessibility Services to take control, places fake overlay screens on banking apps, and steals login details, seed phrases, and even cryptocurrency wallet information.

**How it was handled:**

- Google took action by using Play Protect to block and remove infected apps, even if downloaded outside the Play Store. Security experts recommend avoiding sideloading apps, being cautious of phishing messages, and keeping devices updated.
