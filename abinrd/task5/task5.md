# 7.3 Tbps DDoS Attack

In mid-May 2025, Cloudflare blocked the largest DDoS attack ever recorded: a staggering **7.3 terabits per second**.

The attack targeted a Cloudflare customer, a **hosting provider** that uses Magic Transit to defend their IP network. Hosting providers and critical Internet infrastructure have increasingly become targets of DDoS attacks, as reported in Cloudflareâ€™s DDoS threat report.

The total amount of data sent to the target was **37.4 terabytes**, delivered in **less than a minute**. In context, 37.4 TB roughly equals:

- 9,350 high-definition movies  
- Over 9 million songs  
- 12.5 million photos  

The attack primarily exploited **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** due to its fast, handshake-free delivery, commonly used for real-time applications like video streaming, online gaming, and virtual meetings. This makes UDP floods one of the most common tools in DDoS campaigns.

## Attack Details

- **Average destination ports targeted:** 21,925  
- **Peak destination ports per second:** 34,517  
- **Source IPs:** >122,145 spanning 5,433 Autonomous Systems in 161 countries  
- **Primary attack vectors:** UDP flood, QOTD reflection, Echo reflection, NTP reflection, Mirai UDP flood, Portmap flood, RIPv1 amplification  
- **Percentage of UDP traffic:** 99.996%  
- **Top source countries:** Brazil, Vietnam, Taiwan, China, Indonesia, Ukraine, Ecuador, Thailand, USA, Saudi Arabia

## Attack Types Summary

| Attack Type | Protocol / Port | Mechanism | Prevention / Mitigation | Caution |
|------------|----------------|-----------|------------------------|---------|
| UDP Flood | UDP / Various | High volume of UDP packets to saturate network or appliances | Cloud-based volumetric DDoS protection, rate-limiting, drop unwanted UDP traffic | Aggressive filtering may disrupt VoIP, gaming, or VPN traffic |
| QOTD Reflection | UDP / 17 | Spoofed requests to QOTD servers amplify traffic | Disable QOTD service, block UDP/17, drop abnormal spikes | QOTD is obsolete; safe to disable |
| Echo Reflection | UDP/TCP / 7 | Echo protocol reflects spoofed traffic | Disable Echo service, block TCP/UDP port 7 | Obsolete diagnostic tool; safe to disable |
| NTP Reflection | UDP / 123 | Exploits `monlist` on old NTP servers | Disable `monlist`, restrict NTP queries to trusted IPs, filter UDP/123 | Blocking UDP/123 too broadly may affect time sync |
| Mirai UDP | UDP / Various | IoT botnet floods with random/service-specific UDP packets | Secure IoT devices, update firmware, monitor outbound traffic | Rate-limiting may impact legitimate UDP services |
| Portmap | UDP / 111 | RPC-based reflection attack | Disable if unnecessary, restrict access via ACLs | May disrupt RPC apps like NFS |
| RIPv1 | UDP / 520 | Spoofed routing updates to flood networks | Disable RIPv1, use authenticated RIPv2, block untrusted UDP/520 | Validate legacy routing before changes |

## Attacker Motives

While Cloudflare did not publicly attribute the attack to any group, likely motives include:

- **Testing attack capacity:** attackers may probe Cloudflare and hosting infrastructure limits.  
- **Ransom / extortion:** Q2 2025 saw an increase in ransom-DDoS attempts.  
- **Disruption / geopolitical / competitive:** hitting a hosting provider can affect many downstream customers.

---

## Overall Impact

- **Direct victim impact:** Attack was absorbed by Cloudflare without downtime, but such bursts can require operational response.  
- **Broader ecosystem impact:** Hyper-volumetric attacks strain upstream ISPs, increase mitigation costs, and highlight the need for distributed scrubbing and high-capacity networks.  
- **Record-breaking significance:** 7.3 Tbps is the largest publicly reported DDoS attack, showcasing the growth trend of hyper-volumetric attacks.

## Detection and Mitigation

### Distributed Mitigation
- Target IP advertised via **Cloudflare Anycast**, routing traffic to the closest data center.  
- Mitigation occurred across **477 data centers in 293 locations worldwide**.  

### Autonomous Detection
- All services run in every data center, enabling **fully autonomous detection and mitigation**.  

### Real-Time Fingerprinting
- Packets sampled from **Linux kernel XDP** using **eBPF**.  
- **dosd** (Denial of Service Daemon) analyzes packet patterns, header anomalies, and traffic heuristics.

## Defensive Strategies / Best Practices

- **Cloud-based protection:** Deploy volumetric DDoS scrubbing and CDN solutions.  
- **Rate-limiting:** Apply smart thresholds for UDP and other protocols.  
- **Ingress filtering / BCP38:** Prevent IP spoofing to reduce reflection/amplification attacks.  
- **Disable legacy services:** QOTD, Echo, Portmap, RIPv1, and NTP `monlist` if unused.  
- **Network visibility:** Monitor traffic patterns, ASNs, and ports in real-time.  
- **Incident playbooks:** Include BGP blackholing, upstream ISP coordination, and threat intelligence feeds.  
- **IoT security:** Update devices, change passwords, and monitor outbound traffic.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Automation is critical:** Hyper-volumetric attacks can overwhelm human response.  
2. **Edge distribution matters:** Anycast spreads load and mitigates impact.  
3. **Prevent abuse at the source:** Patch vulnerable services and deploy anti-spoofing.  
4. **Layered defenses:** Combine cloud scrubbing, network filtering, and real-time analytics.  
5. **Operational preparedness:** Incident playbooks and threat intelligence reduce downtime and operational cost.
